        <h2>Birth</h2>
        <p>Johnathan "John" Wick (born Jardani Jovanovich) is a legendary hitman who previously worked for the Tarasov Mob until his retirement. He quit in order to spend time with his wife, Helen Wick,
             who later died of cancer. His superior, Viggo Tarasov, promised to allow John to quit if he first completed an "impossible task": killing all of Tarasov's enemies in a single night.
              Having succeeded, John retired and lived peacefully for just over five years. 
              Following his wife's death, John came out of retirement after Viggo's son, Iosef Tarasov, murdered his dog, Daisy (who was gifted to John posthumously by Helen to help him grieve), and stole his car during a home invasion. 
              John is the titular main protagonist in the John Wick franchise, appearing in
              John Wick, John Wick: Chapter 2 and John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum.</p>
        <h2>Early life</h2>
        <p>The backstory of John Wick is only revealed in small bites in the three films and many elements are therefore open to interpretation. The 2019 film John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum is the first media to provide information about the legendary assassin's early life and upbringing, but details of his origins remain vague. In this movie, it is revealed that John was born under the name of Jardani Jovanovich, and was a Ruska Roma orphan from Belarus, before being taken under the wing of a mysterious criminal operative known as the Director and brought to the United States. Under her tutelage, Jardani developed various martial arts skills. At some point, Jardani adopted the name Johnathan Wick and left the Ruska Roma for undisclosed reasons.<br>
            Beyond the films, the John Wick comics portray him as a young child living as a thief in an impoverished Mexican village. A group of gunmen led by a woman named Calamity blew up John's village in revenge for John's thievery. This failed to kill John, however.</p>

            <h4>Military career</h4>
            John is shown to have a tattoo across his back reading "Fortis Fortuna Adiuvat" ("fortune favors the bold"), which would imply that he was once in the United States Marine Corps 2nd Battalion, 3rd Marines, but this has yet to be confirmed
            <h4>career as a hitman</h4>
            Years after leaving the Ruska Roma, John became a professional assassin who earned the nickname "The Boogeyman" for his unparalleled hyper-lethality. He joined the Continental, a hotel catering exclusively to criminals. His reputation for peerless efficiency and reliability earned him considerable respect and fear within the criminal underworld, ultimately making him an almost legendary figure, known to the leaders of virtually all criminal organizations as someone never to be crossed.
